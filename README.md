**Under construction**

Features that are working:
- Add questions
- Fund questions (in order to answer you need to spend ETH)
- Answer questions
- Basic frontend

Features to be added:
- One question per page (frontend)
- Question has a countdown - will probably use Chainlink Keepers
- Fancier frontend
- Try to differentiate the teacher from the student, so that only the teacher can add questions
- Maybe try to see if there's a way to remove questions, despite them being permanent on the blockchain. Maybe a easy frontend hack
